The death toll in the worst earthquake to hit the Philippines in two decades rose to 171 on Friday, with at least 20 still missing and feared trapped under rubble. Most of the victims were from Bohol province, the epicentre of Tuesday's magnitude-7.2 tremor, where 159 were killed. Bohol is 640 kilometres south of Manila. Twelve were killed in the nearby provinces of Cebu and Siquijor, while 375 were injured, according to the national disaster risk management agency. Emergency workers rushed food, water, medicines, tents and other relief goods to the quake survivors, many of whom were staying outdoors for fear of aftershocks.
