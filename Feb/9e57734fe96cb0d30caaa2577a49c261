“IT’S AFRICA’S TIME” reviews the broad-scale impacts of economic growth and poverty reduction interventions in Ghana, Zambia and Nigeria. “IT’S AFRICA’S TIME” airs on CNBC Africa, DSTV channel 410; on Friday 22nd at 9.30pm and Saturday 23rd at 10.00am CAT. Safe Water for Africa (SWA) is an innovative partnership of The  Coca-Cola Africa Foundation (TCCAF), Diageo plc, WaterHealth International  (WHI), and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to provide access to  sustainable safe drinking water in Africa. "Access to safe water is essential for our company and our world. The  sustainability of water resources is a top priority at The Coca-Cola Company,"  said Bea Perez Chief Sustainability Officer, Coca Cola. Due to population pressures, rising living standards and  urbanization, food scarcity has become a growing problem. With appropriate  access to finance, the agricultural sector can make a significant contribution  to global food security. “This growth is not only driven by commodities but is broad based and  sustainable,” said Dan Mobley, Standard Chartered Regional Head of Corporate  Affairs, Africa. Whilst Nigeria is the leading economy of West Africa, its lack of  transport infrastructure poses a major obstacle to optimum business development. “The WAFMAX (vessel) has improved both efficiency and reliability  because it was custom designed to operate more efficiently in West African  ports. The capacity and fuel efficiency of these vessels means we’re able to  move more cargo for more customers and with fewer ships. That has helped us to  improve service for customers and operate more efficiently in West Africa,” says  Maersk Line’s Sonny Dahl. View Short Promo:   http://youtu.be/jrUTi8S4F-o
