Ngxanga is also accused of sexually assaulting the 13-year-old. Education department spokesman Charles Phahlane at the time said the teacher had been placed on precautionary suspension and was facing an internal disciplinary hearing. Ngxanga's bail of R2,000 was extended and the case was postponed to next month.
